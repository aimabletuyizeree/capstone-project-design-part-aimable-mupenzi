the dates (start and ending), venues where it will take place, and the entry fee (if there's any). <br>
speakers should have a name, picture, short description, and their social media handles (twitter, github, instagram)<br>
app users should be able to search and filter a conference(or meetup or gathering) based on <br>
the criteria cited above. App users should have an account and logged in before joining(or registering on a conference) <br>
